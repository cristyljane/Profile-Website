                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>Sikatuna National High School</p>
                <p>Graduating from Sikatuna National High School was an incredible milestone in my life. Not only did I excel academically, but I also left behind a legacy of determination, leadership, and excellence. During my Senior High years, I embraced a specialized track that not only shaped my future career but also honed my skills in ways that I never imagined. My time there was filled with challenges that I overcame with perseverance, and my efforts paved the way for the success I am now chasing. It was a period of growth, achievement, and unforgettable moments that will always be a proud part of my journey.</p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>Bohol Island State University</p>
                <p>Currently, I am studying at Bohol Island State University, where I am not only expanding my academic knowledge but also embracing personal growth. While I initially aimed to maintain my status as a Dean's Lister, life’s challenges made it difficult to sustain that achievement. However, I didn’t let this setback define my journey. Instead, I pushed forward with unwavering determination and was able to secure a scholarship that has been instrumental in continuing my education. This experience taught me the importance of resilience and that success is not just about perfection, but about perseverance and the willingness to keep going despite obstacles. My college years continue to shape me into a well-rounded individual, ready to take on the world.</p>
